ReinforcementAlgorithm
By Code7G

This is a repository that contains the Reinforcement Learning Algorithm and the functions to use it.
The algorithm has its own separate function, but there are many other useful functions that are combined to
make an app that can use the reinforcement algorithm. This is my first project containing an algorithm I programmed.
I plan on updating this project.
